npm run knex migrate:make users  
Created Migration: /Users/admin/Documents/Galvanize/Capstone/Back-End/Capstone-Back-End/db/migrations/20190131151531_users.js
added file code
npm run knex seed:make 01_users
/Users/admin/Documents/Galvanize/Capstone/Back-End/Capstone-Back-End/db/seeds/01_users.js
may have forgot this. npm run knex migrate:latest

questions answered.

1. did I need to make a 00_clean file first? 
  This file is used to drop the database info and only needs to be created
  once you intend on using this feature. look up other less comlicated examples as well. 
2. why didnt my user file upload with the username and password columns by default when the seeds were created? 
  This just creates the file but doesnt generate an real table date for the seeds that come from the migraction file. for
  example the user seed file is not automatically created with a column titled password or username. Those still
  have to be created manually. 
3. whend do I add the indexedDB.js file into the db? 
  that is a nessasary file that must be created to connect the knexfile.js to the db files to get the tables.

1. wrote the first auth get route. waiting to test
2. got a bcrypt password for the first user. the password is a 
3. with the new change I have to reseed my database to get the password to work. 
4. npm run knex migrate:latest  
5. npm run knex seed:run  
6. forgot to create index.js file. just created index.js file within the db folder. 

Added this code in app.js so the auth files could work with the database info. 
if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'){
  require('dotenv').load()
}

found out how to add an authorization token in the Postman header. You need an authorization header then bearer token-string-no-quotes. Make sure to have the 
space between bearer and the token so the authorization function can split the token out correctly. Also the function must us the split(' ') with the empty space
to properly split the token out. I was able to find this issue with Rodger by console logging the credientials in controll/auth. 

Changed local host for the backend to 5000
added cors() to app.js file. error now is { status: 401, message: 'Unautorized 2' }


Created my user routes and user controller crudes with some edits needed
for more specific profile info. 

Stuck on model users trying to get the get all function to work. I can console.log
which shows the funciton seems to be working. I found out the issue.
I needed to query the database with a promise function not a static function or non-promise dased function.

I build several local CRUD paths. Some are giving me errors 
for updating and deleting. So I am getting something wrong.
Unhandled rejection error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "sessions_pkey"
I needed to add this code in the seeds to solve the issue and allow create and update paths to start after the 
seeded id's sequencial number. so instead of creating a table id of 1 
it starts by addeding after the last id seed being 5 the new row gets an 
id of 6.

Unhandled rejection error: insert or update on table "queues" violates foreign key constraint "queues_request_id_foreign"
this error happend because I didnt create the foreng key number in the
request table first so the queue foreign key could properly reference the
request table. 

I deleted all my seed data during testing and tried to turn off and reboot my server to get it back and 
learned that the proper way to restore the seed data is the rerun the command - npm run knex seed:run

my integer table was too small to take a 10 digit phone number. So I updated the table to a bigInteger.
I did migrate latest and seeds but it looks like I have to rollback
npm run knex migrate:rollback
